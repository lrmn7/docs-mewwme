## It's not difficult to create custom playlists!

---

### Step 1: Making your playlist

- Run the `me create` command plus the name of the playlist you want to create along with the first song/playlist you want to add.

## Optional steps:

### Viewing your custom playlist

- The `me view` command allows you to view your available playlists as well as hone in on a specific one.

### Deleting a specific song from a custom playlist

- The `me playlist-remove` command lets you delete a specific track number from your custom playlist. You can find the track number by running `me view <playlist>` and then `me playlist-remove <song number>`.

### Deleting a custom playlist

- All you have to do to delete a custom playlist is run the `me delete` command and then enter the playlist name you would like to delete.
