## Invite me!

  <span
    style={{
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: color,
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </span>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <Button
        onClick={() => window.open('https://mewwme.is-a.fun/invite', '_blank')}
        buttonStyle="btn--acoustic--1"

        Invite{' '}

          <code>Mewwme's#1406</code>)
        </h2>
        <li>
          Prefix: <code>me</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You should probably click the big invite button ;)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

## Authorization

---

### Step 1

Once you've decided to use the best **companion** on Discord, then you can continue to invite it to your favorite server!

<Image img={require('../../static/img/docs/adding/oauth.png')} />

Tap or click the `Select a server` button. A pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Mewwme.

### Step two

Once you've selected the server that you'd like to add Mewwme to, you can press the `Continue` button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

<Image img={require('../../static/img/docs/adding/oauth-deux.png')} />

:::caution Note
If you want to disable `Administrator` permission from Mewwme, it will not work properly! You will still be able to listen to basic music features but some things won't work.

### Final Step

Once you press the `Authorize` button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected to our thank-you page. In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Spectacular!**

Now let's get the party started by [playing some songs](/play-song)!
